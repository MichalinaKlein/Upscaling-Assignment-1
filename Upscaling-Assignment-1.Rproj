```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Assignment 1

1. Assign the value of five to a variable called a and the value of two to a variable called b.

a <- 5
b <- 2

2. Compute the sum, difference, product and ratio of a and b (a always in the first place) and store the results to four different variables called r1, r2, r3, and r4.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
